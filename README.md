The **ESP8266** is a low-cost Wi-Fi microcontroller produced by Espressif Systems, which became highly popular in the maker community for IoT (Internet of Things) projects due to its affordability, ease of use, and robust wireless capabilities. It predates the ESP32 family and lacks some of the advanced features found in ESP32 models, but it’s still widely used in simpler or budget-constrained projects.

### Key Features of ESP8266:

### Differences between ESP8266 and ESP32:

1. **Processing Power**:
   - ESP8266 has a single-core processor, while most ESP32 models have dual-core processors, making ESP32 better for more complex tasks.

2. **Bluetooth**:
   - ESP8266 does **not** support Bluetooth, while ESP32 models typically support both Bluetooth classic and BLE (except for specific variants like ESP32-S2).

3. **Wi-Fi**:
   - Both ESP8266 and ESP32 support 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, but ESP32 has more advanced Wi-Fi features and better power efficiency, especially in low-power modes.

4. **Peripherals**:
   - ESP32 has more GPIO pins and supports a wider range of peripherals (e.g., ADC, DAC, touch sensors, and USB-OTG in some models), while the ESP8266 has fewer GPIOs and peripherals.

5. **Power Consumption**:
   - ESP32 has better power-saving capabilities with more efficient deep sleep modes, making it more suitable for battery-powered applications.

6. **Performance**:
   - The ESP32 is significantly faster, more powerful, and capable of handling more demanding applications like AI, audio processing, and complex data handling.

### Use Case of ESP8266:
- **ESP8266** is often used for basic IoT applications, such as:
  - Connecting sensors to the internet (e.g., temperature, humidity).
  - Creating simple Wi-Fi web servers for remote monitoring.
  - Controlling devices over Wi-Fi (e.g., home automation).
  - Projects where cost and simplicity are more important than advanced features.

### Modules Based on ESP8266:
- **ESP-01**: Basic module with very few GPIOs and minimal flash.
- **ESP-12E / ESP-12F**: Popular modules with more GPIOs and a 4 MB flash, often used in development boards like the **NodeMCU** or **Wemos D1**.

In summary, the ESP8266 is a simpler, lower-cost alternative to the ESP32, mainly suited for projects that require basic Wi-Fi functionality but do not need Bluetooth or the advanced processing power and peripherals of the ESP32 family.
